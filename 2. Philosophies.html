<h1>Homeschoool Philosophies</h1>
<body>You might be thinking to yourself, "I  am ready to home school!". You probably are right!<br>
One issue we ran into as a family was once we decided to homeschool we uncovered tons of resources. Like An overwhekming amount. So, I would consider this page as a step 1. Before you even begin ordering curriculum and meeting with your ed specialist* I would do  a dive into philosophy. Youll notice this is not "how to" but more of the why which direcet the how. </body>
